# Improve the restore section of Contao Open Source CMS

This extension improves the restore section of Contao by providing more semantic information regarding the deleted elements. The existing core view only provides rather technical information, i.e. the table name the deleted element was stored in and the corresponding sql query. This might be a hurdle to many editors.

We see this extension solely as a research tool. As soon we come up with a solid solution, we aim for a PR to the Contao core.

*Any help or feedback is very much welcome*

## Installation

Install the bundle via Composer:

```
composer require presprog/contao-undo
```
